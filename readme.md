# Main Features

## Cooldowns

Shows your target's, and your focus's cooldowns, as **cooldown icons**.

### Spec Detection

The addon detects spec based on spec talents, the cooldown numbers of course can vary, but I have 
used the most common talent setups as a base, and the worst case scenario.

## Diminishing Returns

Target, Focus, Self Diminishing Return frames. These are also cooldown icons, with a number to show the level.

## Interruptbar

Shows Interrupts around you as cooldown icons, it shows everybody's (for example if there is 2 Warrior around you using pummel,
then it will show both Pummels).

## Combat Log Fix

There is a combat log bug in the client (Well probably it gets some unexpected data from the server) 
both int the TBC and WotLK clients. (Although in WotLK it happens rarely.)
Practicly your combatlog stops processing any new events, a fix is implemented to work around this.

# Optional Dependencies

**OmniCC** - This will put cooldown numbers on the cooldown frames (and of course your spells on the actionbar).
